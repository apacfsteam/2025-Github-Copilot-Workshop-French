## GitHub Copilot Next Edit Suggestions Setup Instructions
Duration: 10

### Overview
⚙️ [`github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled`](vscode://settings/github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled) is a setting that enables GitHub Copilot's next-generation edit suggestion feature. This feature allows you to receive more advanced code editing suggestions.

### 1. Open VS Code

### 2. Access Settings
Open the settings screen using one of the following methods:

#### Method A: From Menu
- **Windows/Linux**: `File` → `Preferences` → `Settings`
- **macOS**: `Code` → `Settings...` → `Settings`

#### Method B: Keyboard Shortcut
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + ,`
- **macOS**: `Cmd + ,`

#### Method C: Command Palette
- `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (macOS)
- Select `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`

### 3. Search Settings
Enter the following in the settings search box:
```
github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled
```

### 4. Enable Setting
- Check the checkbox for the setting item shown in search results
- Or change `false` to `true`

### 5. Confirm Setting
Verify the setting is correctly applied:
- Restart VS Code (recommended)
- Edit code in the editor and confirm the new suggestion feature works

### Alternative Method: Direct Edit in settings.json

#### 1. Open settings.json file
- `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (macOS)
- Select `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`

#### 2. Add Setting
```json
{
    "github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled": true
}
```

#### 3. Save File
- `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + S` (macOS)

### Let's Try It Out

Open the `point.py` file included in the project. This file contains a class representing points in two-dimensional space. Copy the below code snippet into the `point.py` file.

```python
import math

class Point2D:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def distance_to(self, other):
        dx = self.x - other.x
        dy = self.y - other.y
        return math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point2D({self.x}, {self.y})"
```

Now, we want to extend this class to represent points in three-dimensional space. First, let's manually change the class name to `Point3D`. GitHub Copilot will then suggest the next edit candidates.

> aside positive
>
> **Important**: It may take some time for Next Edit Suggestion proposals to appear. Please wait patiently.

The suggestions should show changes like:
- Adding `z` parameter to the `__init__` method
- Adding `self.z = z`
- Extending the `distance_to` method for three-dimensional distance calculation
- Displaying z coordinate in the `__str__` method

In this state, pressing the `Tab` key will move the cursor to the location where GitHub Copilot is making suggestions. To accept the suggestion, press the `Tab` key again.

GitHub Copilot should then suggest the next edit candidate. This suggestion can also be accepted by pressing the `Tab` key. Using Next Edit Suggestion allows you to edit code efficiently.

### Let's See the Results

Let's continue extending the Point2D class to Point3D. You should be able to adapt all methods for three-dimensional space.

Expected final code example:

```python
import math

class Point3D:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z
    
    def distance_to(self, other):
        dx = self.x - other.x
        dy = self.y - other.y
        dz = self.z - other.z
        return math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy + dz * dz)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point3D({self.x}, {self.y}, {self.z})"
```

### Let's Also Try with TODO Comments

Replace `2D` (two-dimensional) with `3D` (three-dimensional) in the commented first line.

```python
# Class representing points in three-dimensional space
class Point2D:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def distance_to(self, other):
        # TODO: Add distance calculation code here
        pass
    
    def __str__(self):
        # TODO: Return string representation
        pass
```

Place the cursor after the TODO comments and check Copilot's suggestions.

### Important Notes

- Make sure VS Code's GitHub Copilot extension is updated to the latest version
- Restarting VS Code is recommended after setting changes

### Troubleshooting

#### If Settings Are Not Found
1. Confirm GitHub Copilot extension is installed
2. Confirm extension is updated to the latest version
3. Restart VS Code and try again

#### If Functionality Doesn't Work
1. Confirm you are logged in to GitHub Copilot
2. Check internet connection
3. Check VS Code console for error messages

## Explain Code
Duration: 15

Let's have Copilot Chat explain this code.

### Open Copilot Chat

1. Click the **Chat** icon (chat bubble icon) in the VS Code sidebar to open Copilot Chat
2. Or open the Chat panel with `Ctrl+Alt+I` (on macOS `Ctrl+Cmd+I`)

### Check Chat Mode

Confirm the chat mode is set to "Question" (we'll introduce "Agent" mode later).

### Request File Explanation

1. Enter `#delivery_manager.py` in the chat field
2. Enter the prompt "Please explain this entire file."
3. Press Enter and Copilot Chat will explain the entire `delivery_manager.py` file

> aside positive
>
> **Tip**: By adding `#` before a filename, you can include that entire file as context.

## Ask About Code Improvement Areas
Duration: 15

### Exercise

Let's ask Copilot Chat about the problematic parts of this code.

### 1. Ask About Overall Class Issues

First, let's ask what problems this code has as a whole class.

Ask Copilot Chat:

```
Looking at this entire DeliveryManager class, what problems and improvement points are there? Please tell me from the perspectives of design patterns, code quality, and maintainability.
```

### 2. Focus on Specific Methods for Improvement Points

Next, let's focus on the `deliver_recipe()` method and ask what methods exist to improve this method.

#### Steps:
1. Enter `#deliver_recipe` in the chat field
2. Candidates for code elements (functions, classes, variables, etc.) will be displayed
3. Select the `deliver_recipe` method
4. Enter the following question:

```
What methods are there to improve this deliver_recipe method? Please make suggestions from the perspectives of readability, performance, and error handling.
```

> aside positive
>
> **Tip**: Using `#` allows you to ask pinpointed questions about specific code elements. This allows you to get more specific and useful improvement suggestions.

### Code Review Function

To improve the current code, ask Copilot Chat:

```
Please improve this Python code. I'd like suggestions from the perspectives of performance, readability, and error handling.
```

### Check from Security Perspective

```
Are there any security issues with this code?
```

### Check Best Practices

```
Please check if this follows Python best practices.
```

## Let's Try Agent Mode
Duration: 10

So far we've been using Copilot Chat in "Question" mode, but now let's try "Agent" mode. Agents can understand user intent and execute tasks more autonomously. Through practical examples, we'll learn how agents function.

### Switch to Agent Mode

First, with the `delivery_manager.py` file open, select "Agent" from the mode selection in Copilot Chat.

<div align="center">
  <img src="github-copilot-workshop/img/agent_mode2.png" alt="Agent Mode Selection 2" width="600" />
  
  <div style="height: 24;"></div>
  
  <img src="github-copilot-workshop/img/agent_mode.png" alt="Agent Mode Selection" width="600" />
</div>

### Identify Issues

Then, enter the following prompt:

```
Please list the issues that exist in the DeliveryManager class. Then, present improvement plans to solve each issue.
```

![Issue Analysis by GPT-4.1](github-copilot-workshop/img/agent_GPT4.1.png)

It should suggest multiple improvement points.

### Try with Different Models

By trying the same question with different models, you can compare the characteristics of each model.

![Issue Analysis by Claude 4.0](github-copilot-workshop/img/agent_Calude4.0.png)

### Implement Improvements

Now let's have them implement the improvement suggestions they provided:

```
Please implement all the improvement suggestions you presented.
```

Copilot will then make direct code changes to the code open in the editor. However, this is still at the suggestion stage, and the user decides whether to accept these changes. You can accept or reject by clicking the "Keep" or "Undo" button above the chat field.

### Agent Autonomy

Here, let's check the comments returned by the agent. The agent didn't just follow instructions and change code, but may also confirm that errors occurred after code changes and try to fix those errors too. In an appropriate environment, the agent automatically detects errors that occur after code changes and attempts to fix them. In this way, agents can understand user intent and execute tasks more autonomously.

### Confirm Command Execution

When using agent mode, Copilot may ask whether it's okay to execute commands. This is because Copilot always asks for user confirmation before executing any command. Check the command content, and if there's no problem executing it, click "Allow this time". This allows Copilot to execute that command and make necessary changes.

> aside positive
>
> **Important**: In agent mode, Copilot operates more autonomously, so make sure to carefully review the suggested changes before accepting them.

## Let's Create a Pomodoro Timer
Duration: 30

So far, we've learned the basic usage of GitHub Copilot available in VS Code. Next, let's actually develop an application.

In this hands-on, we'll develop a Pomodoro timer application. This application has functionality to set work time and break time and manage timers.

We aim to create an application with the following UI:

![Pomodoro Timer UI](github-copilot-workshop/img/pomodoro.png)

Let's first create a new Python file in VS Code. Since we want to create this as a web application, we'll use Flask. Let's name the main file "app.py".

### Project Overview

Create a web timer application for the Pomodoro Technique.

### Required Features
- 25-minute work timer
- 5-minute break timer
- Timer start/stop/reset
- Progress display and statistics functionality
- Browser notifications and sound notifications
- Responsive web UI

## Think About Pomodoro Timer Design
Duration: 10

First, rather than starting implementation immediately, let's consult with Copilot about what approach and design to proceed with. From here on, we'll proceed entirely in agent mode.

What's helpful when creating a web application with UI like this is Copilot Chat's image upload functionality. Using this, you can make Copilot understand your application's UI image.

First, save the UI image from the previous page as `pomodoro.png` in the project root. Then, click `Add Context` in the chat field and select "Image from Clipboard" or "Files & Folders...". Then select the UI image.

![VS Code Copilot Chat Context Menu](github-copilot-workshop/img/add_context2.png)

![VS Code Copilot Chat Context Menu](github-copilot-workshop/img/add_context3.png)

Once the image is uploaded, it will be displayed in Copilot Chat.

Then, enter the following prompt:

```
We plan to create a Pomodoro timer web app in this project. The attached image is a UI mock for that app. What design should we proceed with to create this app using Flask and HTML/CSS/JavaScript? Please suggest an architecture.
```

It will then suggest a recommended web application architecture.

If there are points that should be improved or considerations that are lacking in this architecture, try pointing them out. For example, the following suggestion:

```
Considering the ease of unit testing, please also list any improvements or additions needed to the current architecture.
```

After this exchange, once the architectural design is settled, let's save that content to a file once. By doing so, you can reference the same architectural content even if you open a different chat session.

```
Since the architecture has been settled through our conversation so far, please compile a web application architecture proposal in a file called architecture.md in the project root, based on the content of our conversation.
```

> aside positive
>
> When a conversation with Copilot Chat reaches a conclusion, you can give clearer instructions to Copilot by starting a new conversation. To start a new conversation, click the "New conversation" button at the top of the chat window. At that time, content you want to reference in future chats, like the architectural content this time, is convenient to write out and save to files as we did here.



## Let's List What Needs to Be Done
Duration: 10

Now that the UI mock and architectural design are established, let's consider what specific functionality needs to be implemented. Let's consult with Copilot Chat about this too. At that time, let's attach pomodoro.png and architecture.md.

```
For creating this Pomodoro timer application, please list the necessary functions that need to be implemented.
```

<img src="github-copilot-workshop/img/pomodoro.png" alt="Feature List Consideration" width="400" />

![Feature Identification Example](github-copilot-workshop/img/10-2.list_features.png)

Let's improve this content through chat with Copilot. Once the content is finalized, let's save this content in a file called features.md, just like we did with the architecture.

```
Thank you. That content looks good, so please write the list of functions that need to be implemented in a file called features.md.
```

Now we're about to start implementation, but a tip for mastering Copilot is not to try to implement large functions all at once, but to start implementing small functions first. This improves the accuracy of the code Copilot suggests and allows for smoother development progress.

Let's also consult with Copilot about what granularity to break down and implement this application development. Here, let's attach pomodoro.png, architecture.md, and features.md.

```
I want to implement this Pomodoro timer application step by step. Based on the attached image, architecture, and feature list, please suggest what granularity should be used to implement functions and propose a step-by-step implementation plan.
```

When I tried it, it suggested a plan consisting of 6 steps. If there are points you'd like to see improved, try pointing them out to Copilot. And let's save this content in a file called plan.md so it can be referenced later. Please think for yourself what prompt should be used to give instructions.

## Let's Implement
Duration: 30

Now that all the preparation is complete, let's finally start implementation. Following the implementation plan suggested in the previous step, we'll implement functionality step by step.

### Project Structure Preparation

First, let's create a project directory structure according to our architecture.

First, please modify the current project folder structure to realize an architecture like `architecture.md`. Move files and change configuration files as necessary.

Then, after attaching `pomodoro.png`, `architecture.md`, and `plan.md`, give instructions to Copilot like this:

```
Please implement step 1 of plan.md. If you need to move files that already exist in this project to different directories, please perform that work as well. If there are additional considerations needed, please ask me questions.
```

In my case, it asked questions that needed consideration as shown below. In such cases, provide the necessary information.

![Example Questions from Copilot](github-copilot-workshop/img/12-0.question_from_copilot.png)

After that, Copilot implements step 1. Once implementation is complete, Copilot builds the project on its own initiative and checks for errors. If errors occur, it makes additional corrections to resolve those errors. This kind of autonomous behavior is characteristic of agent mode.

Once implementation is complete, check the following points:

1. **Directory Structure**: Is it structured according to the recommended architecture?
2. **Basic Files**: Are the necessary basic files (app.py, HTML templates, CSS files, etc.) created?
3. **Operation Check**: Perform simple operation tests to see if any errors occur?

Below is the result of step 1 implementation in my case. What kind of application this becomes at this stage will differ from person to person.

![Step 1 Implementation Result Example](github-copilot-workshop/img/12-1.completed_timer.png)




## Let's Write Tests
Duration: 20

Before continuing with implementation, let's write unit tests for the implemented functionality. By writing unit tests, we can confirm that changes in later steps don't affect existing functionality.

If unit tests are already implemented at the stage of the previous page, please skip this page.

### Test Implementation

Try executing a prompt like this:

```
There are no unit tests at all for the current implementation, so please implement unit tests.
```

Copilot agent will then ask whether it's okay to use commands to install dependencies for unit testing. Like this, agents always ask for user confirmation before executing any command. Here, click "Continue" to allow execution of necessary commands.

![Test Implementation Confirmation by Copilot](github-copilot-workshop/img/13-0.test_for_step1.png)

Copilot then executes the previous command in the terminal within VS Code and installs necessary dependencies. Similarly afterwards, Copilot always asks for user confirmation before executing any command. If executing that command causes an error, the agent makes additional corrections to resolve that error.


## Let's Implement Remaining Features (Optional)
Duration: 20

This section is **optional**. Please proceed if you have already learned basic Copilot functions and want to challenge more advanced implementation.

From here, let's implement the remaining features step by step as a free exercise.

Here are some points that should be helpful.

### When You Want to Give Instructions for UI

When you want to give instructions for specific elements on the UI, you can make Copilot recognize those elements by uploading a UI screenshot to Copilot. At that time, it's good to circle or draw arrows on the screenshot to clearly indicate which elements you want to give instructions for.

Alternatively, you can upload two screenshots - the current one and the expected one - to have Copilot check the differences and give instructions to get as close as possible to the expected UI.

### When Giving the Same Instructions Repeatedly

When writing prompts or specifying context, if you're frequently giving similar instructions, you can have Copilot remember those instructions. Specifically, create a file called `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your project and write instructions in it. When this file exists, Copilot automatically loads those instructions and can reference them in subsequent chats.

Below is a sample of custom instructions.

```markdown
This project implements a Pomodoro timer with Flask.

The following are important files in the project. Please reference these files as needed for user instructions.
 - `pomodoro.png`: This is the UI mock of the application.
 - `architecture.md`: This is the application architecture document.
 - `features.md`: This is the list of functions to implement.
 - `plan.md`: This is the step-by-step implementation plan.
```

Additionally, by recording project-specific commands such as commands to build the project or execute tests, Copilot will automatically use those commands.

### When Implementation Doesn't Progress or Bugs Can't Be Resolved

In such cases, try the following approaches:

- Give instructions to output debug information and have Copilot analyze that output.
- Try other models.

## Let's Commit to Git and Push
Duration: 10

Let's commit the created code to the Git repository and push it to a remote branch. Here we'll introduce three methods.

### Method A: Use Commands in Terminal

The traditional method of directly executing Git commands in the terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Pomodoro timer functionality"
git push origin feature/pomodoro-timer
```

### Method B: Use VS Code Source Control

Method using VS Code's integrated Git functionality:

1. Open **VS Code's Source Control tab**
2. Click the **+** button next to **changed files** to add to staging
3. Click the ✨ button to have Copilot generate a commit message

![Source Control Commit](github-copilot-workshop/img/source-control-commit.png)

4. Click the **Commit** button (blue button) to push to the remote branch

### Method C: Use MCP Server (For Those Who Have Set It Up)

If you have already set up MCP server, you can give instructions directly to Copilot in agent mode:

```
Function creation is complete, so please add the code differences to git staging.

Then, please commit with an appropriate commit message and push the changes to the remote branch.
```

![Git Workflow with MCP](github-copilot-workshop/img/mcp-git-workflow.png)


Next, we'll manage the implementation plan as GitHub Issues:

```
Please create issues on GitHub for each step in plan.md
```

This instruction will have Copilot execute the following:

1. Read the contents of `plan.md`
2. Create individual Issues for each step
3. Each Issue will include:
   - Step title and detailed description
   - Requirements for functions to implement
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Appropriate labels and priority

This enables planned project management and agile development.
